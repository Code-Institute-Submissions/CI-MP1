## Background Description

This website has been build for a Bowen Therapist as part of a marketing campaign to :<br>

* Promote and sell the treatment service being offered.
* Provide information about Bowen Therapy.
* Provide information about the Treatment as well as process and pricing.
* Provide information about and build confidence in the therapist.
* Provide booking information for prospective patients.
* Provide information about events the therapist is attending of recommends attending and offers.

I produced a complete Planes Analysis before starting the project : background_work\Planes Analysis-ML Bowen Website.pdf

I also constructed a basic wireframe document prior to starting to write the code : background_work\ML Bowen Wireframe 200608.pdf

The website appears to work on all these platforms without any issues

I have also reviewed the website on

The site functionality appears Ok on all these platforms


## 5. Deployment

I have pushed all the code to GITHUB and have published the main branch (there is only a main branch) at https://kieronoc.github.io/CI-MP1/.
